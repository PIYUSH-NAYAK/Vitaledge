# Order Cancellation Feature Implementation

## âœ… Issue Resolved
**Problem**: Cancel Order buttons were visible but non-functional - they had no onClick handlers.

## ðŸ”§ Implementation Details

### Frontend Changes:

#### 1. OrderDetails.jsx
- âœ… Added `handleCancelOrder` function with proper error handling
- âœ… Added `cancelling` state to show loading state during cancellation
- âœ… Updated Cancel Order button with onClick handler and disabled state
- âœ… Added confirmation dialog for user safety
- âœ… Real-time order status update after successful cancellation

#### 2. OrderHistory.jsx  
- âœ… Added `handleCancelOrder` function with proper error handling
- âœ… Added `cancellingOrders` Set to track multiple order cancellations
- âœ… Updated Cancel Order button with onClick handler and disabled state
- âœ… Added confirmation dialog for user safety
- âœ… Real-time order list update after successful cancellation

### Backend Functionality (Already Existed):
- âœ… `PUT /orders/:orderId/cancel` endpoint
- âœ… Stock restoration when order is cancelled
- âœ… Order status validation (only 'pending' and 'confirmed' orders can be cancelled)
- âœ… Tracking history update with cancellation record
- âœ… User authorization (users can only cancel their own orders)

## ðŸŽ¯ Features Added:

### User Experience:
1. **Confirmation Dialog**: Prevents accidental cancellations
2. **Loading States**: Shows "Cancelling..." while processing
3. **Real-time Updates**: Order status updates immediately without page refresh
4. **Error Handling**: Clear error messages if cancellation fails
5. **Success Feedback**: Toast notification on successful cancellation
6. **Button States**: Disabled state prevents multiple clicks during processing

### Security & Validation:
1. **Order Status Check**: Only pending/confirmed orders can be cancelled
2. **User Authorization**: Users can only cancel their own orders
3. **Stock Restoration**: Cancelled items are returned to inventory
4. **Audit Trail**: Cancellation is recorded in order tracking history

## ðŸ”„ How It Works:

1. **User clicks "Cancel Order"** â†’ Confirmation dialog appears
2. **User confirms** â†’ API call to `PUT /orders/:orderId/cancel`
3. **Backend validates** â†’ Order exists, belongs to user, can be cancelled
4. **Backend processes** â†’ Updates status, restores stock, adds tracking record
5. **Frontend updates** â†’ Order status changes to 'cancelled', success toast shown

## ðŸš€ Now Available:
- Cancel orders from Order Details page
- Cancel orders from Order History page
- Real-time status updates
- Proper error handling and user feedback
