# Toast Message Flow Fixed

## 🔧 Added Complete Toast Feedback

### ✅ What happens when you click "Place Order":

#### 1. **Button Click Detection**
- ✅ Console logs show button was clicked
- ✅ Shows current state (processing, wallet connected)

#### 2. **Validation Checks (with toasts)**
- ❌ **Empty cart**: "Your cart is empty. Please add items to cart before checkout."
- ❌ **Wallet not connected**: "Please connect your wallet first!"
- ❌ **Form incomplete**: "Please fill in: [missing fields]"
- ❌ **Prescription missing**: "Please upload prescription for prescription medicines"

#### 3. **Order Process (with toasts)**
- 🔄 **Step 1**: "Creating your order..." (shows immediately)
- ✅ **Step 2**: "Order created! Initiating payment..." (shows for 2 seconds)
- 🔄 **Step 3**: "Opening wallet for payment confirmation..." (shows until payment)
- ✅ **Step 4**: "Payment confirmed (amount)! Order placed successfully!"

### 🐛 **Why "Place Order" was doing nothing:**

**Before**: Missing feedback during validation and processing steps
**After**: Clear toast messages for every step and error condition

### 🎯 **What you'll see now:**

#### Scenario 1: **Cart Empty**
- Click "Place Order" → Toast: "Your cart is empty..."

#### Scenario 2: **Wallet Not Connected** 
- Click "Place Order" → Toast: "Please connect your wallet first!"

#### Scenario 3: **Form Incomplete**
- Click "Place Order" → Toast: "Please fill in: fullName, phone..." 

#### Scenario 4: **Out of Stock**
- Click "Place Order" → Goes through order creation → Toast: "Insufficient stock for [medicine]"

#### Scenario 5: **Success Flow**
- Click "Place Order" → 
- Toast: "Creating your order..." →
- Toast: "Order created! Initiating payment..." →
- Toast: "Opening wallet for payment confirmation..." →
- Wallet popup appears →
- Toast: "Payment confirmed! Order placed successfully!"
